## Overview
Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly impacted evaluation methodologies in Information Retrieval (IR), reshaping the way relevance, quality, and user satisfaction are assessed. Initially demonstrating potential for query-document relevance judgments, LLMs are now being applied to more complex tasks, including relevance label generation, assessment of retrieval-augmented generation systems, and evaluation of the quality of text-generation systems. As IR systems evolve toward more sophisticated and personalized user experiences, integrating search, recommendations, and conversational interfaces, new evaluation methodologies become necessary.

Building upon the success of our previous workshops, this third iteration of the LLM4Eval workshop at SIGIR '25 seeks submissions exploring new opportunities, limitations, and hybrid approaches involving LLM-based evaluations.

<!-- The workshop will have both an in-person and virtual component, and submissions are welcome even for researchers who cannot attend in person, as they will present their work in the virtual component. -->
## Important Dates
- Paper submission deadline: April 23, 2025 (AoE)
- Notification of acceptance: May 21, 2025 (AoE)
- Workshop date: July 17, 2025


## Topics of interest
We invite submissions on topics including, but not limited to:

- LLMs for query-document relevance assessment
- Evaluating conversational IR and recommendation systems with LLMs
- Hybrid evaluation frameworks combining LLM and human annotations
- Identifying failure modes and limitations of LLM annotations
- Prompt engineering strategies for improving LLM annotation quality
- Standardizing protocols for reliable LLM-based evaluations
- Bias, fairness, and ethical considerations in LLM evaluations
- LLM annotation robustness, reliability, and reproducibility
- User-centric evaluations, personalization, and subjective assessments with LLMs
- Case studies and lessons from industry applications of LLM-based evaluations


## Submission guidelines
- Papers must follow SIGIR format and should not exceed 9 pages, excluding references.
- We accept full papers (published or unpublished), position papers, and demo papers.
- All papers will be peer-reviewed (double-blind) by the program committee and judged by their relevance to the workshop themes and potential to generate discussion.
- Previously published studies can be submitted in their original format and will be reviewed solely for their relevance to this workshop.
- All submissions must be in English (PDF format).
- Submission through EasyChair: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=llm4evalsigir25](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=llm4evalsigir25){:target="_blank"}.

## Publication options

Authors can choose between archival and non-archival options for their submissions:

- Archival: Papers will be included in the workshop proceedings.
- Non-archival: Papers may be uploaded to arXiv.org, allowing submission elsewhere as they will be considered non-archival. The workshop's website will maintain a link to the arXiv versions of the papers.
  
## Presentation
- All accepted papers are expected to be presented in person. We anticipate that at least one author from each accepted paper will attend the workshop in person.
- All accepted papers will have a booster session and a poster presentation.
